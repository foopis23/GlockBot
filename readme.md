# Glock Bot
GlockBot is a currently developing Minigame Discord Bot.

## The Game
The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. 

### Scoring
To score points you must hide the text "kill me" inside of message. The messsage must contain a space between kill and me, but does not require spaces between other works. 

Ex: ✔️ "skill meet", ❌ "killme"

### Killing
If a user spots a message with "kill me" inside of it, they can now accept the invitation. To kill a person shoot them before they score a point by sending 🔫. This will kill the user and take them out of the current game. Don't be to hasty though, or else you might backfire.

### Backfiring
If a user sends a message containing "🔫" while no one is asking to be killed, their gun will backfire. After 2 backfires, the user will kill yourself, knocking themn out of the current game
